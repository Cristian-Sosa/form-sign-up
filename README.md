# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

![Design preview for the Interactive rating component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hello! ðŸ‘‹ GitHub community

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge repository. This is a Frontend Mentor challenge to help me improve my coding skills by building projects.

see the project on the official web: [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) 

## The challenge

My challenge was to develop this interactive rating component.

The final users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a rating number 
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

To do it, I used HTML5, SASS, and VanillaJs.

If someone wants to give me some advice, they are welcome
